# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

### Key Aspects:

1. **File-based Routing**:
   - Uses Expo Router with file-based routing
   - Directory names in parentheses (e.g., `(auth)`, `(tabs)`) create route groups
   - _layout.tsx files define navigation layouts for different sections

2. **Authentication Flow** `(auth)/`:
   - Complete authentication flow with welcome, sign-in, sign-up
   - Password recovery and OTP verification
   - Success screen for completed authentication

3. **Main App Navigation** `(tabs)/`:
   - Tab-based navigation with home, browse, cart, and profile sections
   - Profile section has its own nested navigation stack
   - Each tab represents a major feature of the app

4. **Component Organization**:
   - Reusable components kept in components
   - Context providers in context for state management
   - Constants and types in their respective directories

5. **Data Management**:
   - Static data like product catalog in data
   - Types defined in types
   - Cart state managed through CartContext

### Navigation Flow:

1. App starts at root _layout.tsx
2. Unauthenticated users are directed to `(auth)` group
3. After authentication, users access the `(tabs)` group
4. Profile section has modal screens for settings and preferences
